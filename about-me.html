        <p>I was born in Portland, OR and have lived here for most of my life. I love the state I live in, and I especially love the beautiful wilderness that surrounds me here. I like to go on hikes with my dog and girlfriend, go camping, snowboarding, and all other sorts of outdoor things. I also love old gameboys and like to mod retro gaming consoles in my spare time.</p>
